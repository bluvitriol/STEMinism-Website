    <h2>Hey Girl!</h2>
    <p>We are all aware about the consequences a woman is warned about which she will have to face while being a 'woman in STEM', underrepresentation can be described by perpetual fear of failure surrounding STEM due to the cultural norms and stereotypes swarming our environment. <br>Society needs more girls to join STEM to alter perception and access the numerous benefits of a diverse workforce.<br>
    But here, we assure you that this is a safe space for all our girlys' experiences as well as lessons!<br>
    Empowering women in STEM fields is essential in order to thrive and succeed.
    STEMinists choose science over silence and have come a long way to make the country proud. STEMinism is a shade of feminism that advocates the advancement of women in STEM and we at STEMpedia are all for it.</p>
    <p>So here are some well known STEMinists for your quick dose of inspiration:</p>
    <p>Seetha Coleman-Kammula: A chemist, environmentalist, entrepreneur, and one of the leading women in science is the founder of Simply Sustain.</p>
    <p>Dr. Indira Hinduja: Contributing immensely to the field of gynecology and to the prestige of Indian women in science, she is an infertility specialist based in Mumbai.</p>
    <p>Mallika Srinivasan: The chairperson and managing director of Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited, a company she is known to have led to its present status with revenues of INR 96 billion</p>
    <p>Nandini Harinath: She is a prominent name amongst Indian women scientists having served as the deputy operations director on the Mars Orbiter Mission, Mangalyaan.</p>
    <br>And ofcourse this series will be incomplete without the most famous women in STEM, Marie Curie: Twice a winner of the Nobel Prize, for her remarkable work on radioactivity.</p>
